# SQL_Challenge

## Data Modeling
Entity Relationship Diagram is included or table schemas provided for all tables 

## Data Engineering
1. All required columns are defined for each table 
2. Columns are set to the correct data type
3. Primary Keys set for each table 
4. Correctly references related tables 
5. Tables are correctly related using Foreign Keys 
6. Correctly uses NOT NULL condition on necessary columns 
7. Accurately defines value length for columns

## Data Analysis

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex and salary of each employee.
  ## Output
  ![Alt text](/Query_result/Query_1.png)

    ## Output
    ![Alt text](/Query_result/Query_8.png)

## Submission
1. Create an image file of ERD.
2. Create a .sql file of table schemata.
3. create a .sql file of queries.
4. Regular commits and a thorough README.md file.
